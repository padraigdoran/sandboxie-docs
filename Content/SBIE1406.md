# SBIE1406


**Message:** SBIE1406 Missing or invalid expansion for _variable_: _[xxxxxxxx]_

**Logged To:** [System Event Log](SystemEventLog.md) and [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

This messages indicates that the variable referenced in the configuration file, whose name is noted in the message, cannot be replaced by textual content.

For example, the variables %USERNAME% are expanded to (or replaced by) the user account name. If Sandboxie cannot determine the user account name (see messages [SBIE1408](SBIE1408.md) and [SBIE2209](SBIE2209.md)), then message SBIE1406 will be issued, naming the variable USERNAME.

For a list of expandable variables, see [Expandable Variables](ExpandableVariables.md).

**Template Variables**

If the variable name in the message begins with **Tmpl**, then you should go to [Sandbox Settings > Applications > Folders](ApplicationsSettings#folders) and select a folder location to be associated with the missing variable.

For example, if you see this error message for **Tmpl.Eudora**, go to the _Folders_ settings page, and select a folder for Eudora.
