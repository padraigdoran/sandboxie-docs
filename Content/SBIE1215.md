# SBIE1215

**Message:** SBIE1215 Cannot resolve path to process image _[xxxxxxxx]_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog).

**Explanation:**

Some error has prohibited Sandboxie from identifying the full path to a program that was started in the sandbox. Sandboxie requires the full path in order to identify if the program is installed inside or outside the sandbox. This distinction has an effect on settings such as [OpenFilePath](OpenFilePath) (compare with [OpenPipePath](OpenPipePath)), [ClosedFilePath](ClosedFilePath), [ClosedKeyPath](ClosedKeyPath) and [ClosedIpcPath](ClosedIpcPath).
