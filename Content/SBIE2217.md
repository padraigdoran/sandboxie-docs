# SBIE2217

**Message:** SBIE2217 Request to run as Administrator was denied due to dropped rights

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

The [Drop Rights](RestrictionsSettings#drop) setting is enabled in the sandbox, and this prevents the program from starting with Administrator account privileges.

This message is followed by message [SBIE2219](SBIE2219.md).

**Resolution:** Turn off the Drop Rights setting: [Sandbox Settings > Restrictions > Drop Rights](RestrictionsSettings#drop).
