# How it Works

Sandboxie runs your programs in an isolated space which prevents them from making permanent changes to other programs and data in your computer.

The red arrows indicate changes flowing from a running program into your computer. The box labeled _Hard disk (no sandbox)_ shows changes by a program running normally. The box labeled _Hard disk (with sandbox)_ shows changes by a program running under Sandboxie. The animation illustrates that Sandboxie is able to intercept the changes and isolate them within a **sandbox**, depicted as a yellow rectangle. It also illustrates that grouping the changes together makes it easy to delete all of them at once.
