# Messages From Sandboxie

The _Messages From Sandboxie_ window is displayed automatically whenever Sandboxie logs at least one error or informational message. (For more information about Sandboxie messages, [SBIE Messages](SBIE_Messages).)

The window displays one message per line, as in the example below.

Clicking the _Help_ button opens the Web browser and navigates to the documentation page for the highlighted message.

Clicking the _Hide_ button indicates that you don't wish to receive this message again. If the message contains an information detail, the _Hide_ button hides the message only in combination with that particular detail.

For example, the [SBIE1304](SBIE1304) messages shown above has the detail _osk.exe_. In this case the _Hide_ button will hide future occurrences of [SBIE1304](SBIE1304) for _osk.exe_. If [SBIE1304](SBIE1304) is issued for some other progam name, it will still be displayed.

Clicking the _Close_ button closes the window.
