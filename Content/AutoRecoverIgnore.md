# Auto Recover Ignore

_AutoRecoverIgnore_ is a sandbox setting in [Sandboxie Ini](SandboxieIni.md). It specifies folders or file types that should be ignored by the Immediate Recovery extension of [Quick Recovery](QuickRecovery.md). For example:

```
   .
   .
   .
   [DefaultBox]
   AutoRecoverIgnore=.part
   AutoRecoverIgnore=%Desktop%
   AutoRecoverIgnore=C:\Folder
```

The first example excludes from Immediate Recovery any files ending in _.part_. These files are created by the download manager of the Mozilla browsers, and represent incomplete downloads. When the download completes, the _.part_ extension is removed from the file, thus making it eligible for Immediate Recovery. Note that _.part_ is a default setting.

The second and third examples exclude the specified folders from Immediate Recovery.
