**Explanation:**

**Possible Causes**

*   Sandboxie was configured to block access to the folder containing its program files. See [Sandbox Settings > Resource Access > File Access > Blocked Access](ResourceAccessSettings#file).

**Known Conflicts**

The message: SBIE2313 Could not execute SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe

May be caused by the combination of Sandboxie and versions of [PC Tools Firewall Plus](http://www.pctools.com/firewall/) prior to 5.0.0.38, if the Enhanced Security Verification (ESV) feature was enabled in the firewall software.

To resolve this conflict, please upgrade to the version 5.0.0.38 or later of PC Tools Firewall Plus.
