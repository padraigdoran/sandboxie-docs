# SBIE1153

**Message:** SBIE1153 Sandboxie initialization failed. Close all programs and then re-install Sandboxie OR restart your computer.

**Logged To:** [System Event Log](SystemEventLog) and [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog).

**Explanation:**

The driver component of Sandboxie completed its first phase of initialization, but failed during the second phase of initialization. The driver remains loaded in the system, but is disabled.

You may try to resolve the problem by re-installing Sandboxie, which stops the driver and starts a new instance of the driver. Alternatively, you may restart your computer.

In some cases this problem occurs due to some conflict with third-party security software.
