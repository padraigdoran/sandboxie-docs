# SBIE1314

**Message:** SBIE1314 Blocked request to alter network/firewall settings by process _program.exe_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

This message indicates that a program attempted to change TCP/IP network configuration, and the request was blocked. Sandboxie may issue this message when it blocks a program from attempting to change the IP address or routing tables for the local computer, or other networking parameters.

Note that at this time, the message is not actually issued when a program attempts to change firewall parameters, but the program will not be able to modify the parameters of the firewall.

To permit a program to alter network and firewall paramters, please see the following settings:

Related [Sandboxie Control](SandboxieControl.md) setting: [Sandbox Settings > Restrictions > Hardware Access](RestrictionsSettings#hardware)

Related [Sandboxie Ini](SandboxieIni.md) settings: [BlockNetParam](BlockNetParam.md).
