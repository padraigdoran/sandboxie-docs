# SBIE2327


**Message:** SBIE2327 Error in COM server: _[yy / xxxx]_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog).

**Explanation:**

In some specific cases, Sandboxie acts as a communication channel on behalf of a sandboxed program, and forwards specific requests to a COM object which is executing outside the sandbox.

The communication channel is implemented as _SbieSvc.exe_ programs which are started by the Sandboxie service component (which is also called _SbieSvc.exe_). This message reports that an error has occurred in one of those _SbieSvc.exe_ programs that serve as a communnication channel.

This communication channel is used when a sandboxed program tries to contact a COM object using a CLSID identifier which matches the [OpenClsid](OpenClsid) setting.
