# SBIE3207


**Message:** SBIE3207 Cannot find the Internet Explorer executable

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

The Sandboxie Start.exe program attempts to identify the location for Internet Explorer executable program file by looking at information contained under the following registry key:
```
    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\iexplore.exe
```

Typically, the information is contained in the default value of this registry key:
```
    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\iexplore.exe\shell\open\command
```

This error message indicates that the required information could not be extracted from the registry.

**Resolution:**

Consider working around this problem by using the [Add Shortcut Icons](ConfigureMenu.md#windows-shell-integration) function in [Sandboxie Control](SandboxieControl.md) to create a shortcut directly to Internet Explorer.
