# SBIE1405


**Message:** SBIE1405 Configuration file error in line _number_: syntax error

**Logged To:** [System Event Log](SystemEventLog.md) and [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

The [Sandboxie Ini](SandboxieIni.md) configuration file is structured as a set of sections. Each section begins with a section name between brackets, for example: [GlobalSettings].

Within each section, each line must be formatted as _name=value_.

Alternatively, a line in the configuration file may be blank, or may begin with the hash character (#), in which case the line is considered a comment and is ignored.

This message indicates that some text in the configuration file could not be parsed according to the syntax described above.
