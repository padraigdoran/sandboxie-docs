# SBIE1306


**Message:** SBIE1306 Sandboxie driver (SbieDrv) cannot be unloaded now

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog).

**Explanation:**

The Sandboxie driver component is in use and cannot be unloaded at this time.

Note that the Sandboxie driver component does not respond to the standard, generic "Stop Service" request, until a Sandboxie-specific "Prepare to Stop" request has been issued. The Sandboxie-specific request may fail if the driver is in use by any other program at the time the request is issued.

If the Sandboxie-specific request succeeds, the driver component disables itself, and waits for the generic "Stop Service" request before it is unloaded from memory.

Note also that the driver component does not honor stop requests from a program that is running under the supervision of Sandboxie.
