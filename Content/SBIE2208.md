# SBIE2208


**Message:** SBIE2208 Cannot remove registry hive: _[[ntstatus](NtStatusCodes)]_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog).

**Explanation:**

When all sandboxed programs end, Sandboxie removes the sandboxed registry from the system. This error message indicates the removal was unsuccessful.

Typically the _ntstatus_ code is C0000121, and indicates that some other program is using the sandboxed registry, _from outside the sandbox._

Note, as long as the registry remains loaded into the system, the sandbox cannot be deleted. Logging-off the current user account may resolve the problem.
