# SBIE3209


**Message:** SBIE3209 Cannot find the executable for the default mail agent

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

The Sandboxie Start.exe program attempts to identify the location for the Web browser executable program file by looking at information contained under the following registry key:
```
    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\mailto
```

And the actual information comes from either of these registry keys:
```
    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\mailto\shell\opennew\command
    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\mailto\shell\open\command
```

This error message indicates that the required information could not be extracted from the registry.

**Resolution:**

It may be possible to fix this problem by forcing your mail program to reset itself as the default mail program for the system. Different programs provide this feature in different ways, so please consult the documentation for your particular mail program.

Alternatively, consider working around this problem by using the [Add Shortcut Icons](ConfigureMenu.md#windows-shell-integration) function in [Sandboxie Control](SandboxieControl.md) to create a shortcut directly to the web browser program.
