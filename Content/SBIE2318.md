# SBIE2318


**Message:** SBIE2318 DLL initialization failed for _library.dll_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

The sandboxed program issued a request to load the system DLL named in the message. Some functionality in some system DLLs does not work "out of the box" when running sandboxed, due to the restrictions placed on the sandboxed program. In these cases, Sandboxie has to alter the DLL in order to assist it in accomplishing its tasks.

The message indicates Sandboxie could not "fix" the system DLL.
