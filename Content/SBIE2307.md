# SBIE2307


**Message:** SBIE2307 Could not map drive _x__[[ntstatus](NtStatusCodes)]_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog).

**Explanation:**

Internally, Windows does not recognize drive letters such as A: or C: and instead uses a naming scheme that identifies devices. For example
```
	\Device\Floppy0
	\Device\HarddiskVolume1
```

May be the internal name for drives A: and C: respectively.

Sandboxie works in this lower level of Windows and uses the internal names. But for convenience, when files are stored in the sandbox folder, they are stored as _\sandbox\drive\a_ and _\sandbox\drive\c_.

Therefore for every drive, Sandboxie needs to know its associated internal name, so it can map, for example, between C: and _\Device\HarddiskVolume1_.

This message indicates that Sandboxie failed to find the internal name for the drive _x_ noted in the message.
