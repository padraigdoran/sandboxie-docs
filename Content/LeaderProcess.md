# Leader Process

_LeaderProcess_ is a sandbox setting in [Sandboxie Ini](SandboxieIni.md). It specifies names of programs that are considered primary in the sandbox, and when they stop running, all other programs in the sandbox are stopped as well. For example:
```
   .
   .
   .
   [DefaultBox]
   LeaderProcess=iexplore.exe
```

_iexplore.exe_ is Internet Explorer.
