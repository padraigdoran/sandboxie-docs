### Visibility

Sandboxie is primarily a mechanism to run other programs, not an interactive tool. You will typically hide the main window of Sandboxie Control, and the program will only be visible as a tray icon in your system notification area, typically at the lower-right corner of the screen:

(Note the yellow Sandboxie Control icon near the clock.)

To toggle the hidden state, double-click the tray icon, or right-click it and select the _Show Window_ or _Hide Window_ commands. (See [Tray Icon Menu](TrayIconMenu).) Additionally, you can hide the window by clicking the close button (X) at the upper-right corner of the window.

To quit Sandboxie Control and remove its tray icon from the system notification area, right-click the tray icon and select _Exit_.
