* Learn more about [Quick Recovery](QuickRecovery.md) and [Immediate Recovery](ImmediateRecovery.md). 

* Tips specific to a browser: [Internet Explorer Tips](InternetExplorerTips.md) and [Firefox Tips](FirefoxTips.md). 

* Run your email program sandboxed, for better [Email Protection](EmailProtection.md). See also [FAQ Email](FAQ_Email). 

* Learn how to use Sandboxie to [defend against keyloggers](DefendAgainstKeyLoggers.md). 

* Use the [Add Shortcut Icons](AddShortcutIcons.md) button to create shortcuts to run your programs sandboxed. 

* Identify sandboxed windows and programs using the [File Menu -> Is Window Sandboxed?](FileMenu#iswindow) command. 

* [Force Programs](ForcePrograms.md), such as your Web browser, to always run sandboxed. 

	* [Disable Forced Programs](DisableForcedPrograms.md) when you need to run a "forced" program not under the supervision of Sandboxie. 

* Use [Sandbox Settings > Forced Folders](SandboxSettings#folders) to protect CDROM and DVD drives. 

* Create [more sandboxes](#MoreBandboxes) for better isolation of separate programs. (The Paid version of Sandboxie allows you to run the same program in multiple sandboxes at the same time) the non-paid, shareware version limits a particular program to 1 (one) sandbox at a time, but you can have virtually unlimited sandboxes.) 

        Note: To run a program sandboxed means to invoke it under the supervision of Sandboxie.
