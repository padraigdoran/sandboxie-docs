# SBIE2212


**Message:** SBIE2212 Email reader _program.exe_ is not configured to run sandboxed

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

This message is displayed when you run your mail reader program sandboxed, but have not yet enabled proper support for that program in Sandboxie.

Sandboxie offers quick configuration for most email programs. Please see [Sandbox Settings > Applications > Email Reader](ApplicationsSettings.md#email-reader), and then [Test Email Configuration](TestEmailConfiguration.md).

By default, Sandboxie traps all changes in the sandbox, including changes to mailbox files, such as the addition of new mail. These changes will be deleted when the sandbox is deleted. To properly run your mail program sandboxed, you should configure Sandboxie to exclude your mailbox data files from sandboxing. For more information, see [Email Protection](EmailProtection.md).
