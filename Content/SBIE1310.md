# SBIE1310

**Message:** SBIE1310 Extended features are disabled until the license is reactivated

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

Extra features of Sandboxie were only available for registered licenses before Sandboxie became free software with no limitations (since version 5.31.4). This message indicated that the license has expired.

The [FAQ Licensing](https://sandboxie-website-archive.github.io/www.sandboxie.com/FAQ_Licensing.html) page listed those extra features that were available only in the registered versions of Sandboxie.

**IMPORTANT:** In general, this message does **not** mean that you have to pay for Sandboxie again.

~~To renew your license, invoke the Sandboxie License Manager: Open [Sandboxie Control](SandboxieControl.md). You can find it in your Windows Start menu, under the Sandboxie program group. Then, select the [Help Menu](HelpMenu.md) and invoke the **Register Sandboxie** command.~~
