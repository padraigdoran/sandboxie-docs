# SBIE1310

**Message:** SBIE1310 Extended features are disabled until the license is reactivated

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog).

**Explanation:**

Extra features of Sandboxie are only available when Sandboxie is registered and the license is activated. This message indicates that the license has expired and should be renewed in order to use the extra features.

The [FAQ Licensing](FAQ_Licensing) page lists those extra features that are available only in the registered version of Sandboxie.

**IMPORTANT:** In general, this message does **not** mean that you have to pay for Sandboxie again. You need only take a moment to manually renew your license to Sandboxie and activate your Product Key.

To renew your license, invoke the Sandboxie License Manager: Open [Sandboxie Control](SandboxieControl). You can find it in your Windows Start menu, under the Sandboxie program group. Then, select the [Help Menu](HelpMenu) and invoke the **Register Sandboxie** command.

Please see [Product Activation](ProductActivation) for more information.
