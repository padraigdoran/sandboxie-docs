# SBIE2306


**Message:** SBIE2306 Could not locate user directory: _[[ntstatus](NtStatusCodes.md) / yy]_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

Sandboxie attempts to enhance the portability of the sandbox by storing personal (also known as "user profile") files in a folder that has a generic name rather than a specific one.

For example, instead of storing files in
```
	\sandbox\drive\c\Users\joe\Documents
```

Sandboxie prefers to store files in
```
	\sandbox\drive\c\user\current\Documents
```

This means you can use the same sandbox with some other user account or even some other computer.

This message indicates that Sandboxie failed to find the user profile folder, and does not know which folder to associate with the sandbox folder _user\current_.
