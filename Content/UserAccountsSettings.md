This settings page can restrict use of this sandbox to specific user accounts. The Add User button opens a standard Windows user account selection dialog box which can be used to find and select specific user accounts. User account groups may also be specified.

A sandbox that has been restricted to specific users is considered hidden to all other user accounts. Those other user accounts will not see the sandbox listed in [Sandboxie Control](SandboxieControl), and [Forced Programs](ForcedPrograms) and [Forced Folders](ForcedFolders) settings will not apply to those user accounts.

A user account to which any sandboxes are hidden will have the [Reveal Hidden Sandbox](RevealHiddenSandbox) command appear in the [Sandbox Menu](SandboxMenu) in [Sandboxie Control](SandboxieControl).
