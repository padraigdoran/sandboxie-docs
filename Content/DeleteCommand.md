# Delete Command

DeleteCommand is a sandbox setting in [Sandboxie Ini](SandboxieIni.md). It specifies the command to issue to physically delete the contents of the sandbox. Its primary purpose is to make it possible to plug a third-party secure deletion utility into Sandboxie. [See Secure Delete Sandbox](SeeSecureDeleteSandbox.md).

Usage:
```
   .
   .
   .
   [DefaultBox]
   DeleteCommand=%SystemRoot%\System32\cmd.exe /c RMDIR /s /q &quot;%SANDBOX%&quot;
```

The example is the default setting used when DeleteCommand is not explicitly specified, and invokes the Windows RMDIR command to remove the sandbox folder.

For more examples, see [Secure Delete Sandbox](SecureDeleteSandbox.md).

***

When specifying this setting, make sure to include **"%SANDBOX%"** (with quote marks) in the command.

Note: Secure deletion is a privacy measure, not a security measure. Both regular deletion and secure deletion effectively remove undesired software that was collected into the sandbox. [See Secure Delete Sandbox](SeeSecureDeleteSandbox.md).
