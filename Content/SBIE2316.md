# SBIE2316


**Message:** SBIE2316 Memory corrupted

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

The memory areas that Sandboxie maintains within the sandboxed programs have been corrupted. This could be due to an error in Sandboxie which causes it to corrupt its own memory, or due to an error in the sandboxed program which causes it to corrupt the memory areas that are owned by Sandboxie.

The sandboxed program immediately aborts.

Note that a sandboxed program cannot corrupt these memory areas in an attempt to circumvent Sandboxie. Sandboxie effects its restrictions through its driver component, which cannot be damaged or altered in any way by a sandboxed program.
