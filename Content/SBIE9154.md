# SBIE9154


**Message:** SBIE9154 Driver (SbieDrv) and service (SbieSvc) have different version numbers

**Logged To:** [System Event Log](SystemEventLog.md)

**Explanation:**

The service component of Sandboxie (SbieSvc) has a different version number than the driver component (SbieDrv). To resolve this problem, try to re-install Sandboxie over itself (an update/upgrade installation). If that does not resolve the problem, try to uninstall Sandboxie and re-install a fresh copy.
